# Graphics-Project-Updated

This project is for our CS 412 course final.

To use the program be sure to download all of the assets and main js files in a single folder. The controls are on the sidebar,
you can use mouse mode or fly which uses keys (in this mode you can use left click and your mouse to move your view also).

Our professor Dr. David Wolff provided guidance and the framework that we built on.
Emily Sugimoto and Noel Sigafoos added onto or completely created all of the assets and code for the skybox and it's shader,
the scene shader, a majority of scene.js(namely loading and translating objects, the skybox, and clouds). We also created all of the cloud/square
shaders and functions used to create our particle effects. We also created the controls and modified the UI for aesthetic purposes.
